## Heyo There! 👋
I'm Maketendo, I'm a learning developer (in the UK) trying to be better to code!

I mainly like to code Minecraft mods, but I'd want to try some more stuff!

Some facts:
- I like cats (and I have one)
- I used to code in MCreator, but i'm learning more and more java!
- I like computers!
